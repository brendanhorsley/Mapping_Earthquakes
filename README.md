# Mapping Earthquakes

The purpose of this assignment was to work with Leaflet and geoJSON to produce maps of earthquake data.
Specifically, I created a dark mode tile layer, which allows users to select an easier on the eye darker version of the map.
Then I added the tectonic lines to the map.
Finally, I created a new interactive feature on the legend to allow the user to only view major earthquakes, i.e. larger than 5.0 magnitude.
